Networking basics #1 This project was the second of two introducing networking. I continued to learn about IP addresses while practicing manipulating them with Bash scripts.
0-Change your home IP :  Bash script that configures an Ubuntu server as follows: localhost resolves to 127.0.0.2 facebook.com resolves to 8.8.8.8
1-Show attached Ips :Bash script that displays all active IPv4 IP's on the machine. 100. Port listening on localhost
100-port_listening_on_localhost: Bash script that listens on port 98 on localhost.
